### Hi there 👋

I'm a senior studying Software Engineering at LSU 🐯. Currently, I'm working on a game for LSU's game jam! In the upcoming semester, I'll be diving into various school projects, studying AI, and studying cloud computing. All projects I have contributed to and worked on can be found in the starred section of my profile!

🌱 Open for work opportunities.
